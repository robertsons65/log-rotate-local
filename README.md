# Log Rotate Local

*Poor-man's logrotate for a Windows service log.*

## What Log Rotate Local is

**Log Rotate Local** is a desktop utility. Rotate a log file by size and keep N dated copies.

A service writes one file until the disk fills.

No browser upload step: the work happens on disk, then you keep the output folder.

## What's included

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## What it does

- Size threshold
- Keep N
- Dated names
- Optional compress

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
